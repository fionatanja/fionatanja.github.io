	One day, this website will be perfectly set-up to host all my projects, but until that day comes, this website will be a project in and of itself. The Github repository this site is hosted on should theoretically include a log of all that changes I've made (pushed?), but since I don't know how to decipher whatever the heck is going on in Github, I'm keeping my own list of changes here, in addition to a list of future fixes.
