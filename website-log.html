	One day, this website will be perfectly set-up to host all my projects, but until that day comes, this website will be a project in and of itself. The <a href="https://github.com/fionatanja/fionatanja.github.io">Github repository</a> this site is hosted on should theoretically include a log of all that changes I've made (pushed?), but since I don't know how to decipher whatever the heck is going on in Github, I'm keeping my own list of changes here, in addition to a list of fixes for next time.

	<div class="block"> 
	<h2>fixes for next time</h2>
	<li>Link title to the home page</li>
	<li>Add favicon</li>
	<li>Change bullet points from classic bullet-y shape to something fun, like "+", stars, etc.</li>
	<li>Properly align different components, e.g., justify body text but not the title, or create a section divider that's centered within the column</li>
	<li>Build out the "About" and "Lists" pages</li>
	<li>Build out the infrastructure for the "Blog" and "Portfolio" pages</li>
