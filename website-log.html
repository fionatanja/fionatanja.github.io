	One day, this website will be perfectly set-up to host all my projects, but until that day comes, this website will be a project in and of itself. The Github repository this site is hosted on should theoretically include a log of all that changes I've made (pushed?), but since I don't know how to decipher whatever the heck is going on in Github, I'm keeping my own list of changes here, in addition to a list of future fixes.

	<h2>to-do</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Link page titles to the homepage.</li>
		<li>Properly align different components, e.g., justify body text but not the title, or create a section divider that's centered within the column.</li>
		<li>Build out the "About" and "Lists" pages.</li>
		<li>Build out the infrastructure for the "Blog" and "Portfolio" pages.</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="block"> 
	<h2>changelog</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>[6/20/23] Made bullet points cuter. Added a favicon.</li>
		<li>[6/19/23] Semi re-built entire site from 2019 version and re-learned "pushing" to Github. </li>
