	<h2>Smallholder Palm Oil Farmers in Indonesia</h2>
	<h3>Undergraduate Thesis (Spring 2019)</h3>
	<span>The research completed in this work will be expanded in 2020 for my Master's thesis.</span><br><br>
	My work examines the role of environmental policies and certification schemes on smallholder farmers in Indonesia's palm oil industry, in a literature review format. The process in which palm oil is planted is carbon-intensive and environmentally destructive, resulting in Indonesia having one of the highest rates of primary deforestation and carbon emissions in the world. Independent smallholder farmers are vulnerable populations with limited access to greener technologies and are often unfairly (and unintentionally) targed by environmental and economic policies. Smallholder palm oil farmers are expected to grow in share relative to the industry. To improve environmental and economic outcomes in this sector, it will be necessary to understand and fix smallholder access to greener technologies and market certification programs. <br><br>
