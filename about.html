	<div class="block"> 
	Hello! I'm <span class="highlight">Fiona Tanuwidjaja</span>, and welcome to my little corner of the internet!<br><br>

	I was born in Jakarta and moved around a bit, ultimately growing up in Seattle and attending college in Boston at MIT (where I studied Urban Planning and Economics). Since then, I've been living in San Francisco with three roommates and my bird, Peaches. I'm in my mid-twenties now, which seems very old and gives me a scare whenever I remember.<br><br>

	Currently, I work at <a href="https://www.climateworks.org/" target="_blank">ClimateWorks Foundation</a> as the Data Lead for the <a href="https://www.driveelectriccampaign.org/" target="_blank">Drive Electric Campaign</a>, a philanthropic campaign to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles. Outside of work, I do the usual things: reading, yoga, catching up on TV shows, and hanging out with friends. I've also been into journaling and writing the occasional essay; this has been mostly for myself, but I'm looking forward to putting some of these musings on this site. Recently, I've been interested in learning about the history of Maritime Southeast Asia and the Chinese diaspora, the identity and reputation of major US cities, and design and data visualization.<br><br>

	I'm extremely bad with social media, but if you are so inclined, you can find me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fionatanja/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fionatanuwidjaja/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, or send me an email at <a href="mailto:fiona.tanuwidjaja@gmail.com">fiona.tanuwidjaja@gmail.com</a>.
