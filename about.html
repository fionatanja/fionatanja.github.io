	Hello! I'm Fiona Tanuwidjaja, and welcome to my little corner of the internet!<br><br>

	I was born in Jakarta and have moved around a bit, ultimately growing up in Seattle and attending college in Boston at MIT (where I studied Urban Planning and some Economics). Since then, I've been living in San Francisco with three roommates and my bird, Peaches. I'm in my mid-twenties now, which seems very old and gives me a scare whenever I remember.<br><br>

	Currently, I work at <a href="https://www.climateworks.org/" target="_blank">ClimateWorks Foundation</a>, a climate philanthropy. Specifically, I'm the Data Lead for the <a href="https://www.driveelectriccampaign.org/" target="_blank">Drive Electric Campaign</a> (a campaign to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles). Outside of work, I do the usual things, like reading, yoga, catching up on TV shows, and hanging out with friends. I've also been into journaling and writing the occasional essay; this has been mostly for myself, but I'm looking forward to putting some of these musings on this site. Recently, I've been interested in learning about Southeast Asia and the Chinese diaspora.<br><br>

	I'm extremely bad with social networks, but if you are so inclined, my Instagram is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fionatanja/" target="_blank">here</a>, and my LinkedIn is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fionatanuwidjaja/" target="_blank">here</a>. I'm in a weird time in my life where I'm actually much more active on LinkedIn than Instagram. Speaking of which, maybe I'll upload my resume here too...
