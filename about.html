	Hello! I'm Fiona Tanuwidjaja, and welcome to my little corner of the internet!<br><br>

	I was born in Jakarta and have moved around a bit, ultimately growing up in Seattle and attending college in Boston at MIT (where I studied Urban Planning and some Economics). Since then, I've been living in San Francisco with three roommates and my bird, Peaches. I'm in my mid-twenties now, which seems very old and gives me a scare whenever I remember.<br><br>

	Currently, I work at <a href="https://www.climateworks.org/" target="_blank">ClimateWorks Foundation</a>, a climate philanthropy based in SF. Specifically, I'm the Data Lead for the <a href="https://www.driveelectriccampaign.org/" target="_blank">Drive Electric Campaign</a> (a philanthropic campaign to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles). Outside of work, I do the usual things: I like to read, catch up on TV shows, try new restaurants, and hang out with my loved ones (these things often overlap with each other). I've also been into journaling and writing the occassional essay; this has been mostly for myself, but I'm looking forward to putting some of these musings on this site. Recently, I've been interested in learning about Southeast Asia and the Chinese diaspora.<br><br>

	I'm extremely bad with social networks, but if you are so inclined, my Instagram is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fionatanja/" target="_blank">here</a>, and my LinkedIn is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fionatanuwidjaja/" target="_blank">here</a>. I'm in a weird time in my life where I'm actually much more active on LinkedIn than Instagram. Speaking of which, maybe I'll upload my resume here too...
